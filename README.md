# Play with TTS

Welcome to **Play with TTS**! This repository is dedicated to exploring the world of Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies, showcasing trending tools, and creating engaging voice synthesis projects. Dive in and discover how TTS tools can bring text to life with natural-sounding voices.

## Project_1: Voice Synthesis with Kokoro B-AI

The first project in this repository focuses on **Kokoro B-AI**, a cutting-edge tool for voice synthesis. Kokoro B-AI provides advanced features to generate high-quality, expressive, and customizable synthetic voices. This project demonstrates how to utilize Kokoro B-AI for:

- Generating human-like voice output from text.
- Fine-tuning voice parameters for different emotions and tones.
- Exploring multilingual voice synthesis capabilities.
